# TopoHealth: A Lung Cancer Diagnostic AI

For my undergraduate capstone project, I created an AI to diagnose lung cancer in CT 
scans. This experimented with a number of techniques from computational geometry and 
topology, both for mesh manipulation and in constructing the actual models. 

The project ended 
up being more accurate than human radiologists, on average. With 
Joaquin Monterrosa, I then hosted these models in an intuitive web application.

In the end, our project won a number of awards. These included
the "Best Pitch" and "Biggest Idea" in the MSU "Big Idea Challenge" each for
$500,
as well as the "Best Capstone Award" from the MSU School of Computing for $1000.
I hope to continue this project and 
related work in the future, both during my graduate studies and in a career 
thereafter.
