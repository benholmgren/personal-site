# TopoHealth: A Lung Cancer Diagnostic AI

For my undergraduate capstone project, I created an AI to diagnose lung cancer in CT 
scans. It ended up being more accurate than human radiologists, on average. With 
Joaquin Monterrosa, I then hosted these models in an intuitive web application. The 
whole package won the MSU School of Computing "Best Undergraduate Capstone Award" for
$1,000.
