Discrete Morse theory is the extension of classical Morse theory on smooth manifolds to the discrete setting. It can be deeply promising, though it is not a silver bullet, in broad applications throughout topological data analysis. I find discrete Morse theory particularly enjoyable to work with in an algorithmic setting because there are three canonical interpretations one can employ, as displayed in the above figure (these are combinatorial, algebraic, and topological). This is fun, because different interpretations can yield entirely different insights and invariants.

# Installation
**Jekyll is a Ruby Gem that can be installed on most systems.**
### Requirements
* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/){:target="_blank"} version 2.5.0 or above, including all development headers (ruby version can be checked by running ruby -v)
* [Ruby Gems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download){:target="_blank"} (which you can check by running gem -v)
* [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/){:target="_blank"} and [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/){:target="_blank"}

### After Installing the Requirements you can follow these guides:
**For detailed install instructions have a look at the guide for your operating system.**
* [macOS](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/){:target="_blank"}
* [Ubuntu](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ubuntu/){:target="_blank"}
* [Other Linux Distros](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/other-linux/){:target="_blank"}
* [Windows](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/){:target="_blank"}

### Creating a new Jekyll site
**We can create a new Jekyll site just by a simple command:**<br>
> # `jekyll new my-site`

Jekyll will create a new directory named as `my-site` which is customizable (i.e., you can change the name from `my-site` to anything you want for example `jekyll new brutus`).

### Changing into the Directory
**We have to go inside the directory:**<br>
> # `cd my-site`

Again, `my-site` is just a random name which is customizable.

### Building the site and making it available on a local server
> # `bundle exec jekyll serve`

### Browsing your Jekyll site
> # Browse to [`http://localhost:4000/`](http://localhost:4000/){:target="_blank"}
