# TDA Broader Accessibility and Instruction

### Topology for Data Science Workshop

Alongside Brittany Fasy, David Millman and Jordan Schupbach, I helped to create a tutorial project for
techniques in TDA and the R 'TDA' package, thanks to help from the Montana State University Undergraduate Scholars Program. 
This culminated in an NSF funded workshop, postponed due to COVID-19
in Spring of 2020 and set to happen in Fall of 2020. My work on this was even a featured research preview in the
[Montana State University News](https://www.montana.edu/news/19766/msu-undergraduate-helps-make-complex-computer-science-more-accessible).

### R Package 'TDA' Documentation

When I first started getting interested in TDA, I worked on documentation for the R package 'TDA', which then
led to the above tutorial project.
