description: It is often useful to study spaces of graphs living in a metric
ambient space for many application areas in GIS and networks. Some of my research studies and defines these spaces rigorously.

Title: 'Path-Connectivity of Fr\'echet Spaces of Graphs'

Abstract: 

We examine topological properties of spaces of paths and graphs mapped to $R^d$ under the Fr√©chet distance. 
We show that the spaces of graphs and paths mapped to $R^d$ are path-connected if the map is either 
continuous or an immersion. If the map is an embedding, we show that the space of paths is path-connected, while the space of graphs only maintains this property in dimension 4 or higher.
