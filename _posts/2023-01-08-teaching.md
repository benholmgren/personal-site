This page includes the slides for a number of talks I've given, primarily in seminars and book clubs in the CompTaG group at MSU.

### Topology for Data Science (T4DS) Workshop

> The T4DS Workshop is currently taking applicants. See our [flyer](../assets/flyer.pdf)

Alongside Brittany Fasy, David Millman and Jordan Schupbach, I created a tutorial project for
techniques in TDA and the R 'TDA' package in my first year at Montana State University. 
This culminated in an NSF funded workshop, postponed due to COVID-19
in Spring of 2020 and set to happen in Spring of 2023. The teaser website is [here](https://comptag.github.io/t4ds/). My work on this was even a featured research preview in the
[Montana State University News](https://www.montana.edu/news/19766/msu-undergraduate-helps-make-complex-computer-science-more-accessible).

### R Package 'TDA' Documentation

When I first started getting interested in TDA, I worked on documentation for the R package 'TDA', which led to the above tutorial project. A summary of that project is included in the poster below.
