# 60 Words About the Author
author-about: I am a researcher from Bozeman, Montana working at the intersection of mathematics and computer science. I am especially drawn to topology and geometry, computational complexity theory, algorithms, and their diverse applications in GIS and healthcare. I have also spent a lot of my life running around in the mountains, mostly in Montana and Alaska.
