## Me

There are two places that I would so far call home: Montana, where I was raised and 
attended college, and Alaska, where I moved immediately upon graduating. Many facets 
of these two fantastic places are highlighted in my page on mountains. Both have 
given my life a great deal.

Though, far more important than geography, home is defined by people. Here are mine.
