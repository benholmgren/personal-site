## Me

There are two places that I would so far call home: Montana, where I was raised and 
attended college, and Alaska, where I moved immediately upon graduating with my partner, who is pursuing a 
career in rural medicine. These two fantastic places are highlighted, in small part,
in my page on mountains. Both have 
enriched my life a great deal.

Though, far more important than geography, we are defined by people. Here are mine. (And our awesome dog, Rosie, when she was a puppy. She's a total rascal.)
